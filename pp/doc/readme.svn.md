Kstmm/python
============

This is a set of libraries of useful python code common to:

  * `Kstmm/SelCode/python`
  * `SwaveMeasurement/python`

### Contents
  * Stuff for generic `pyROOT` in `utils/root`
  * Stuff for generic `pyROOT.RooFit` in `utils/roofit`
  * Stuff specific to the kstmm analysis in `kstmm`

### Usage
None directly. Just make sure setup scripts prepend the path to this folder.

### Warning
Docstrings. Use docstrings. And comments. My python code. My rules.

### Git mirror
This project (`utils`, `kstmm`, and `doc`) form a subset of modules in the `sam` python package which I keep in git.
This should be invisible but please don't delete random `.git` or `.gitignore` files that might be lying around.
The `sam` package is [here](http://github.com/green0eggs/sam).
