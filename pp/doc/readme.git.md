Particle physics related functions. 

### This repository
There are several sub modules:

 * `lhcb.grid`: Functions specifically for looking at grid job output from the LHCb flavour of ganga
    (job efficiencies, output checking, etc).
 * `utils.root`: Tuple/file utility functions to make my life using `pyROOT` easier.
 * `utils.roofit`: Useful `pyROOT.RooFit` utility functions.
 * `kinematics`: Some phase space and kinematics functions.
 * `kstmm`: Objects and functions that define things specifically to do with the K*&mu;&mu; analysis.
 * `pi0mm`: Objects and functions specifically to do with the &pi;<sup>0</sup>&mu;&mu; analysis.

### SVN mirror
Additionally, there is an SVN mirror of the following directories:
 `kstmm`, `utils`, and `doc`; which form my `Kstmm/python` SVN directory.
